# Wine-Quality-Prediction

This repository contains my machine learning project for wine quality predictions. 

This project was conducted in R and compiled in a Jupyter notebook with the goal of using machine learning in order to automate the process of prediction wine quality given 11 attributes of each wine. This was achieved by using a random forest  model, a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifications and regression.

The model assessment concludes that that the random forest yields predictions on the test data with 72.5% accuracy. Given the domain that this data comes from, this could be a valuable tool. The report also offers next steps for model improvement. 

Please view the .ipynb file for the full analysis.
