# Wine-Quality-Prediction

This repository contains my machine learning project for wine quality predictions. 

The project was conducted in R and compiled in a Jupyter notebook with the goal of using machine learning in order to automate the process of predicting wine quality. The wine quality is given by 1 of 6 quality rankings and is predicted by 11 attributes for each wine. This was achieved by using a random forest model, a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifications and regression.

The model assessment concludes that that the random forest yields predictions on the test data with 72.5% accuracy. Given the domain that this data comes from, this could be a valuable tool. The report also offers next steps for model improvement. 

Please view the .ipynb file for the full analysis.
